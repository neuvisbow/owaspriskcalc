# OWASP Risk Calculator

This project is an implementation of the OWASP Risk Calculator, a tool used to assess the risk level of a given scenario based on various factors including threat agent capabilities, vulnerabilities, technical and business impact.

## Description

The OWASP Risk Calculator is a web-based tool that calculates the overall risk score of a scenario by evaluating several factors related to threat agents, vulnerabilities, technical impact, and business impact. It provides a user-friendly interface to input these factors and visualize the calculated risk score.

## Features

- Allows users to input various factors influencing the risk level, such as threat agent skill level, motive, opportunity, vulnerability ease of discovery, exploit, awareness, intrusion detection, and more.
- Calculates the likelihood and impact scores based on the provided factors.
- Displays the overall risk score along with its severity level (Low, Medium, High, Critical) and color-coded indication.
- Provides a visual representation of the risk scores using a bar chart.


## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Input the required factors for threat agent, vulnerability, technical impact, and business impact.
3. The likelihood and impact scores will be automatically calculated and displayed.
4. The overall risk score and its severity level will be shown along with a visual representation using a bar chart.
